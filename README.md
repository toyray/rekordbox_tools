This repo contains tools for working with Rekordbox.

## doc_playlist.py

This Python script parses the Rekordbox Library XML file and prints the list of
playlists. User is prompted to select a single playlist and the script will
print the comments and hotcue info for each track in the playlist.

I use track comments to store notes on track transitions and hot cues as bookmarks
for a specific playlist. This script allows me to "backup" playlists for reference
so that I can use the same track in another playlist with a different set of hotcues.
